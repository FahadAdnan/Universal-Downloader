A current minimum-viable-product of an application made to Download, Play, and Alter Music. 
The inspiration for this project was to find an alternative to subscription based services like Spotify.
Current Developers on this project: Fahad Adnan and Zayd Adnan

There are 3 main features of the application: 
### ‚¨áÔ∏è Downloader 
- I keep most of my music on youtube, so it made sense to have a youtube downloader, I have looked at other libraries such as youtube-dl for android but many are bloated due to the inclusion of Python needed for downloading, currently I am using lightweight library for downloading but it is unreliable so I am planning on making my own for this project.
### üéµ Music Player and Equalizer 
- The plan is to add a built in music player in the app which is to accompany the Equalizer, I like to change the speed of music and as I couldn't find any music players with that capability it was a feature I wanted in this app, the equalizer was so that I could get the best listening experience and to act as an alternative to basic equalizers included in headphones apps such as senheisser. 
### üíª Floating Widget 
- I added a floating widget similar to Facebook Messanger so that I could download videos quicker while watching youtube videos.
