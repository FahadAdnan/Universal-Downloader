# Universal-Downloader
A current minimum-viable-product of an application made to Download, Play, and Alter Music. 
The inspiration for this project was to find an alternative to subscription based services like Spotify.

There are 3 main features of the application: 
### ‚¨áÔ∏èDownloader 
- I keep most of my music on youtube, so it made sense to have a youtube downloader, I have looked at other libraries such as youtube-dl for android but many are bloated due to the inclusion of Python needed for downloading, currently I am using lightweight library for downloading but it is unreliable so I am planning on making my own for this project.
### üéµ Music Player and Equalizer 
- The plan is to add a built in music player in the app which is to accompany the Equalizer, I like to change the speed of music and as I couldn't find any music players with that capability it was a feature I wanted in this app, the equalizer was so that I could get the best listening experience and to act as an alternative to basic equalizers in headphones apps such as senheisser. 
### üíª Floating Widget 
- I also added a floating widget similar to Facebook Messanger to make it quicker when using.
